###PCML Project II, Las Vegas group

####Required external dependencies:

1. Piotr toolbox in PeopleDetection/PiotrToolbox. Can be found [here](http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/piotr_toolbox.zip);
2. Images input. Can be found [here](http://cvlabwww.epfl.ch/~cjbecker/pcml_project2/persondetectionTrain.zip);

####Notes

1. paternnet function in PersonDetection/ExampleCode/personDetectionExample.m does not work without toolbox which we don't have
2. I propose we assume in our code everywhere that it is called from the 'root' directory, PersonDetection/ or MusicRecommendation/. Example code is modified to work accordingly.
